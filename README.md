# carousel
A relaxing series of carousels I made from scratch

I always wanted to make a carousel, but with more interesting effects.

I particularly liked the idea of treating it like a deck of cards. Infinitely long, looping decks, or simply the same one swiping on and off the top of the deck.

It's a small project, but neat and simple. I understand that carousels are a little outdated now, but I actually quite like them, visually.

Deck 1: Simple end-to-end ribbon style. Cards are static relative to one another.

Deck 2: Vertically scrolling deck-of-cards effect. Cards return at end.

Deck 3: Horizontal deck-of-cards, with returning animation times staggered to approximate the effect of friction
